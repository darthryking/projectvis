# Project VIS
Simple prototype of a 2D visibility/LOS algorithm.

This project was an attempt for me to implement what at the time seemed to be a novel gameplay idea and an interesting mental exercise/coding challenge. It was also an attempt for me to apply what I know about Binary Space Partitioning (which I had previously only learned of during my experiences with the Source Engine) to an actual project.

I may or may not revisit this in the future, but for now I have ceased work on it in favor of more immediately important projects. I learned a lot attempting this though, and I thought working through the many challenges of implementing a BSP tree (no matter how simplistic and super-buggy!) was a very fun mental exercise, despite the fact that I'm pretty bad at geometry! (And oh does this project require a LOT of geometry work...)
